# Daily resume

### Mon January 8

Initialized the project. Create the GitHub repository, READMY, LICENSE.
Chosed the project topic and searched for supportive data.
Created project proposal.


### Tue January 9

Searched for datasets. Had to adjust project proposal. One more
visualisation different from map, scatterplot and linechart. Found one 
extra dataset about immigration and emigration that makes the project a 
bit more interesting. Decided to make two piecharts: one with countries
of origin, one of countries of destination in 2010 or 2015.


### Wed January 10

Project proposal approved. Completed the three datasets: GDP.csv, 
happiness.csv and migration.csv. 
Created DESIGN.md file, a sort-of extension of the README.md file.
Added LICENS file and .gitignore file.


### Thu January 11

Started working on scripts to convert csv files to json. migration.csv
is complex and takes a lot of time and effort.
Preperation for presentation on Friday.


### Fri January 12

First presentation went well. Continued working on scripts to convert 
migration.csv file to json. Created a simple worldmap on index.html,
created worldmap.js file. Added necessary libraries.
