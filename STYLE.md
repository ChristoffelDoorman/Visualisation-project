# Style Guide

The following guidelines are followed about the ordening and sturcrute of the Github repository and the guidlines of Javascript, CSS, html and Python code:

## Github repository
The github repository contains four directories:
* data: this directory contains all the raw data sets, some cleaned up for better processing.
* doc: this directory contains all images, sketches and formatted text files.
* project: this directory contains all files necessary for the visualisation to work. The directory has three subdirectories:
  * javascript: This directory contains all javascript files used in the application. In addition, the used libraries are stored in the directory 'libraries'.
  * data: This directory contains all the json files with data used in the application.
  * css: This directory contains all style sheets for the visualisation.
* scripts: This directory contains the scripts that are used to convert the raw-data files into useful json files.

Beside these directories, the repository contains a licence file, a 'process'-file that describes the process of the project day by day, a readme file, this styleguide, a 'design' file about the design of the project and the html file (index.html).
