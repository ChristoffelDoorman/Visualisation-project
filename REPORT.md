## Story of visualisation

Since the ages of the hunting and gathering, people are constantly moving their living places all over the world. In the modern
world, most people's intention is not looking for new food or wildlife: people migrate because of their work, they
flee from war, social captivity, or other reasons. Two variables that may summarize these reasons, are Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) and happiness. This web-application shows the average GDP per capita and happiness rates of
countries in the world. Select a country and see what the the origins of immigrants and destinations of emigrants
are. Did those migrants seek for money or happiness?
